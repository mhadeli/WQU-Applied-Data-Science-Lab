# Data Science Lab Overview

This repository showcases the eight data science projects completed as part of a learning program with WorldQuant University, Applied Data Science Lab. Each project is designed to reinforce core concepts through hands-on experience. Students were required to complete four self-paced lessons for each project, followed by a programmatically graded assignment, achieving a minimum score of 90% for each assessment.
